# hello-world
Just a repository created to learn how GitHub works. This is an edit done in the readme-edits branch of the hello-world respository.
When the branch was created, it was copied from the default master branch, but from this point on it can be edited and change without affecting the original master branch.  
Later, any changes can be updated to the master branch if needed.
